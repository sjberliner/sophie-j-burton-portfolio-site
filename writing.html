            <p>talkin about a road trip, talkin about our rain dance<br>
so as the rain hit we were Cab Calloway cool.<br>
smoking out back, crying to the sky.<br><br>
maybe i fell when you walked towards me?<br>
i should have lost my head but there was something<br>
in the smell of the soil that kept me and i learnt not to question.<br><br>
the sun was silent in the houses and their bricks,<br>
boulders cracked smiles, old friends passing us for good.<br>
and you blew smoke into my face, you dirt.<br><br>
which can’t mean anything other than you hated me everyday.<br>
even now as your mouth holds tomorrow:<br>
cuckoo, egg, waltz.<br><br>
but there it was, going and going through the sore sand.<br>
your hips missed, when you pinned me against the fence<br>
of the diner as we kissed.<br><br>
my sticky back scratched with the honey from breakfast<br>
and the pulsing in my temple felt like your fingers<br>
on the dashboard when they spelled out:<br><br>
no matter where i go, i’m going<br><br>
and going.
